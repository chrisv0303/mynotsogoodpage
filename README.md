# Sample Website
This is a sample website to learn the basics of coding and to continue learning more down ahead. This is most likely the least enthusiastic website I've createdbut with more practice, I'll be sure to create better websites. You can follow nowhere!

After reading -Learn Enough Git to be Dangerous-, I'll know enough how to use Git to track changes, commit my work, check statuses, create branches, etc.
